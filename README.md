# Repo-Interface
This is a React project to vizulize the gitlab/github API. 

## Justification for project

While you could always run a 

```
curl -headers 'PRIVATE-KEY: $YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' -X GET -url 'https://your-super-cool-repo.com/api/issues' 
```

and use the functionality of the API in that way it is always nice to have some kind of real tool to do the work. Additionaly the code that is showen in this project will be a good example of how Axios works should any other devs need a referance. I could see another dev taking this project and impleminting it into their own work change a few things up and you have an easy to use tool that can create gitlab issues. Maybe when a common user runs into an error or hits a "get help" button the tool takes their input and converts it into a gitlab issue that the devs can easily access and track. 

Also I can always use some practice in React. :)
